# ParseMastering

Parses the math notation used by Pearson and converts it into syntax that DuckDuckGo and other equation parsers recognizes.

This project was an exercise of implementing context-free grammars. I had learned this in freshman year at WPI, and I thought that this would be a good way to practice actually using it. Pearson for physics uses a proprietary format for its expression editor, and it's annoying to type out the expression again if I need to use a calculator. So I made this program to convert from Pearson's format to a format that any search engine will understand. I also added functionality to just do the calculation locally too to speed up my work.
